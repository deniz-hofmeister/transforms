A blazingly fast and efficient coordinate transform library for robotics and computer vision applications.

## Overview

This library provides functionality for managing coordinate transformations between different frames of reference.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/transforms). 

## Features

- **Interpolation**: Smooth linear interpolation between transforms at different timestamps.
- **Transform Chaining**: Automatic computation of transforms between indirectly connected frames.
- **Thread-safe Operations**: Safe concurrent access to the transform registry.
- **Time-based Buffer Management**: Automatic cleanup of old transforms.
## Usage

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use transforms::{
    geometry::{Quaternion, Transform, Vector3},
    time::Timestamp,
    Registry,
};

let mut registry = Registry::new(Duration::from_secs(60));
let timestamp = Timestamp::now();

// Create a transform from frame "base" to frame "sensor"
let transform = Transform {
    translation: Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
    rotation: Quaternion::identity(),
    timestamp,
    parent: "base".into(),
    child: "sensor".into(),
};

// Add the transform to the registry
registry.add_transform(transform).unwrap();

// Retrieve the transform
let result = registry.get_transform("base", "sensor", timestamp);
```

## Relationship with ROS2's tf2

This library draws inspiration from ROS2's tf2 (Transform Framework 2), a widely-used transform library in the robotics community. While this crate aims to solve the same fundamental problem of transformation tracking, it does so in its own way.

### Similarities with tf2

- Maintains relationships between coordinate frames in a tree structure.
- Buffers transforms over time.
- Supports transform lookups between arbitrary frames.
- Handles interpolation between transforms.

### Key Differences

- Is a pure Rust implementation, not a wrapper around tf2.
- Makes no attempt to perfectly match the ROS2/tf2 API.
- Focuses on providing an ergonomic Rust-first experience.
- Is independent of ROS2's middleware and communication system.

## Non-Goals

This library intentionally limits its scope to rigid body transformations (translation and rotation) commonly used in robotics and computer vision. The following transformations are explicitly not supported and will not be considered for future implementation:

- Scaling transformations
- Skew transformations
- Perspective transformations
- Non-rigid transformations
- Affine transformations beyond rigid body motion
- Converge to parity with ROS2 / tf2
- Extrapolation

## Roadmap

There is currently only a single goal on the roadmap. 
- Make this library no_std compatible and allow the std functionality behind a feature flag.
